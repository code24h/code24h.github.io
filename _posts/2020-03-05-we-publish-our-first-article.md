This page is created just today, thanks to my GĐ whose life is dedicated for IT community. He like to share about coding practices, helps IT students in their assignment and implement fancy ideas to support his juniors. I would like to take this chance to say thanks to GĐ.

I'm a coder, a content creator, which my content is all about code and what's in my mind when I code.
Recently I took a chance to learn about machine learning and hopefully I will be able to write something about it soon.
